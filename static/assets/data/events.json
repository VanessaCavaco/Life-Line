Support for various projects Hangar-type  and offices with a modular structure. My work at Gaptek has evolved providing me to grow professionally with a focus on technology. I have enriched my knowledge in Autodesk Revit in raising three-dimensional and informed Models, going through the creation of Families with the rigor of production. The information management of the model, managing it from the creation of the family to the insertion in the model and subsequent measurement and production. The need to accurately account for each element of the model for subsequent production, purchase and assembly has allowed me to work with Dynamo and Excel for the information management of the Bim Model and Navisworks for the control of design and assembly errors. The diversity of projects developed by Gaptek has also allowed me to coordinate BIM models and adapt templates and develop Dynamo routines for correct modeling and subsequent parameter management. In addition to Revit, Dynamo and Navisworks I have had the opportunity to use tools such as Presto and Cost it for extraction of measurements.",
