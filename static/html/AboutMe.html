    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h3>Constanctly learning to improve the impact of tecnology in Architecture.</h3>
    <p>
        As a Portuguese Architect in Barcelona, I've witnessed technology's transformative impact on AECO (Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operation). 
        From hand-drawn designs to collaborative, data-driven processes, tools like CAD and BIM have revolutionized our field. 
        Today, architects use diverse digital tools across disciplines and project phases, enhancing accuracy. 
        The evolution extends beyond design to the entire project lifecycle, managing assets with digital twins. 
        Despite benefits, challenges like interoperability persist, especially for smaller firms. 
        I see myself not just as a design architect but as one embracing technology and software engineering. My goal is to blend architectural expertise with technological innovation, contributing to a future where architecture and technology seamlessly converge. 
        Ready for new adventures, I aim to shape a future where these elements harmoniously coexist.
